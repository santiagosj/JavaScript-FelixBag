/**
 * ## Initializing Variables

The way a variable is initialized determines which scope type it is:

### Lexical Scope

var is used to denote a variable which is Lexically Scoped to the current
function:

    function someFunc() {
      var aVariable;
    }

aVariable is lexically scoped within someFunc

### Block Scope

let & const are used to denote variables which are Block Scoped to the
current curly braced block:

    if (true) {
      let aVariable;
    }

aVariable is block scoped within the if's curly braces

 function foo(){
     var bar;
 }
